# Preside Extension - Image Map

This Preside extension adds client-side image map functionality to images added to rich text areas via the imagepicker plugin.

It uses code from the [Summer HTML image map creator](https://github.com/summerstyle/summer) (released under the MIT licence) and has been modified for use within Preside.
